The project aims to apply machine learning methods to examine driving contexts and user traits obtained from an e-commerce platform. The goal is to predict the likelihood of users accepting coupons while traveling, thereby refining the strategy for coupon distribution and boosting user interaction with the platform’s services.

The data encompasses various driving contexts, such as the user’s intended destination, current time, weather conditions, companions, details about the coupon, and both user-specific and situational characteristics. Users are then asked whether they would accept the coupon under these specific conditions.
